		Team Self Evaluation Form, Assignment #2

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they
worked together and what to write for the evaluation.

(1) List the names of your team members:

A: Quan Luo

 
B: Sumanth Cherupally

 
 
(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project, in HOURS.

  	                        A      B
meetings 	  	  	          3      3
coding 	  	  	            12     10
writeup 	  	  	          3      4
planning (alone) 	  	  	  10     10
total (including meetings) 	28     27


(3) Describe 
  (a) what the major responsibilities of each team member were;
  Both developing algorithm and writing report. No explicit division.
  (b) whether or not you completed the assignment;
  Yes we've completed the assignment
  (c) the major strengths and weaknesses in your team, e.g. how
      your team worked together;
  Strength - We both implement the algorithm and discuss with each other when we're blocked.
  Weakness - We're both procrastinators.. Thus we start the project relatively late.
  (d) the lessons learned from these events;
  We have to discuss more in the early phase and start earlier.
  (e) whether and how you plan to change the way your work together and
  We could plan and divide the work better and organise better. Plan and work organised timeline.
  (f) anything else that comes to mind.
  I think it's a good learning opportunity for us both to implement the algorithms and analyze results.
